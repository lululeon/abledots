## Developer Guide

- This codebase uses typescript and is based on a nodejs **[vite](https://vitejs.dev/)** app with **[svelte](https://svelte.dev/)** (just because / an excues to try svelte - but this thing doesn't have a UX yet).
- The package manager for this repo is `pnpm`, so to run the app after pulling / forking this repo:
  - `pnpm install`
  - `pnpm dev`
- There are two apps:
  - `GOL.svelte` - the main app
  - `Test.svelte` - a visual testing app. For now it is just three 3x3 grids representing initial state and 2 follow-up iterations. The test variant cells have a larger aperture and are labelled; additionally there are some extra console logs for debugging.
